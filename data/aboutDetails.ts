    aboutParagraphs: `
      The story of Christ Family Center basically has been an adventure of faith. Born from what started as a small community fellowship known as All Christian Families Fellowship (ACFF), for Benue Cement Company staff and those living in the suburbs in Benue State, Nigeria it has become Christ Family Center International Churches that is growing and making impact in the lives of people all around the world today.
      In the early days of January 2001 God directed Pastor Arome to get ready for a change that will mark the end of ACFF after about 8 years of operating as a community fellowship. God told him the era of ACFF had come to an end and it was time for the beginning of new things. That new beginning was the birth of Christ Family Ministry with Christ Family Center Amua as the home church on 16th September 2001. That same year God dealt with Pastor Arome about moving into the town of Gboko (20 minutes' drive from Amua) to start another GROWTH TRACK | 14 branch of the church.
      In obedience, he moved to Gboko the following year and started Christ Family Centre, Gboko on 17th February 2002 with a membership of three. God in His wisdom knew the company was going to go bankrupt and its eventual closure will lead to the staff being subsequently dismissed. With this development, most of the CFC members at the BCC Factory Housing Estate left and those remained joined the church in Gboko town known then as Christ Family Centre, Gboko but known today as Christ Family Center International Churches.
      Today, God has blessed and increased Christ Family Ministry with other Church branches, Campus student fellowships; Love is King Campaign (a Community Development initiative), Media and other ministries that are imparting lives all around the world. In 2011, our Makurdi branch was launched with the same vision of reaching our city and environs with the beautiful message of our Lord Jesus Christ. As CFM continues to increase and grow, the vision remains consistent – CFM is a church that believes in God's unconditional love for people and the power of the gospel message in raising happy and successful people.
